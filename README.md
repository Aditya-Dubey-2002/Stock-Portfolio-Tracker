## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Recommended version: 16.x or higher)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) (For the backend database)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (For managing dependencies)


### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Dubey-2002/Stock-Portfolio-Tracker/
  cd Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
  ```

#### 2. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```
Install dependencies: Ensure that you have Node.js installed, then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up the database:

Create a MySQL database for your project. You can do this via the MySQL CLI or use a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE stockitup_db;
```
Add your MySQL credentials to a .env file in the backend directory:
```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=stockitup_db
DB_PORT=3306 # optional, can be commented in src/config/db.js
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key
```
Run the Backend: To start the backend, use:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start your Express server, and the backend will be available at http://localhost:5000.


#### 3. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies: Ensure that you have Node.js installed, then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Configure the Backend URL: Open the src/config.tsx file in the frontend and update the SERVER_URL value to point to your local backend:

```tsx
const config = {
  SERVER_URL: 'http://localhost:5000', // Define your server URL here
  // SERVER_URL: 'https://stock-portfolio-tracker-2oud.onrender.com', // Uncomment for production deployment
};


export default config;
```

Start the Frontend: To start the frontend, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, and the frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

#### 4. Set Up Finnhub API
To integrate the Finnhub API for real-time stock prices, follow these steps:

Create a free account on Finnhub: Finnhub Signup
After logging in, go to the API Keys section and get your API Key.
Add your API Key to the .env file in the backend directory under the FINNHUB_API_KEY variable:
```bash
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key
```

#### 5. API Integration
The frontend and backend will communicate through API requests. You should ensure that the backend is running and properly configured to fetch the real-time stock price data.

---

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider checking the following:

CORS Issues: If you face issues with cross-origin requests, ensure that you have enabled CORS in your backend using the cors package.
API Keys for Stock Price Integration: Make sure your API key for Finnhub is correctly set up in the .env file for the backend.
Database Connection: Ensure that your MySQL database is correctly set up and running. Check your .env variables for accuracy.

### Running Tests
Currently, there are no tests written for the application. However, you can manually test the core features by interacting with the frontend and backend. We will add automated tests in future updates.
