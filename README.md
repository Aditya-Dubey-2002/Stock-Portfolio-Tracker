### Database

The database architecture consists of three primary tables: **Users**, **Orders**, and **Holdings**. These tables are designed to ensure robust data management and maintain application integrity.

#### Schema Details:
- **Users**: Stores user information, including personal details, bio, balance, and profile image.
- **Holdings**: Tracks user stock holdings with details like quantity, purchase price, and total investment.
- **Orders**: Logs buy and sell orders with information about stock type, order type, and timestamps.

Example Schemas:
```javascript
const User = sequelize.define('User', {
    userId: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true },
    fullName: { type: Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false },
    email: { type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true, allowNull: false },
    password: { type: Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false },
    balance: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, defaultValue: 10000 },
});

const Holding = sequelize.define('Holding', {
    holdingId: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true },
    userId: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, references: { model: User, key: 'userId' } },
    stockId: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false },
    quantity: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },
    buyPrice: { type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2), allowNull: false },
    totalPrice: { type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2), allowNull: false },
});

const Order = sequelize.define('Order', {
    orderId: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true },
    userId: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, references: { model: User, key: 'userId' } },
    stockId: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false },
    orderType: { type: DataTypes.ENUM('buy', 'sell'), allowNull: false },
    quantity: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },
    amount: { type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2), allowNull: false },
});
```
#### Database Integrity:
- Transactions: Ensure ACID properties are maintained during critical operations like stock purchases or sales.
- Caching: Frontend caching prevents repetitive API calls for similar requests made within 15 seconds.

#### Real-Time Data Handling
The application dynamically updates stock prices and metrics every 15 seconds, ensuring users have the latest market data without overwhelming external APIs.
Approach:
- Store static data (e.g., holdings, investments) in the database to reduce real-time dependencies.
- Fetch real-time stock prices in the backend, process metrics (current values, top-performing stocks), and pass them to the frontend.
- Implement caching on the frontend to avoid redundant API calls for frequently requested data.
- This architecture ensures a balance between real-time updates and system efficiency, providing users with an optimal experience while maintaining API call limits.

---

## üöß Challenges, Limitations, and Future Improvements

### üî• Challenges Faced
1. **API Rate Limit Handling**:  
   Managing the refresh rate was tricky as frequent calls exceeded the API limit. This was resolved by implementing **local storage caching** to reduce redundant API calls within 15 seconds.

2. **Syncing Random Stock Allocations with User Balance**:  
   While placing buy orders for randomly allocated stocks, inconsistencies arose between user balances and holdings. This was fixed by leveraging **database transactions** to maintain ACID properties.

3. **Writing Documentation**:  
   Let‚Äôs just say it was a test of endurance‚Äîbut hey, it builds character, right? üòÑ

---

### üö´ Limitations and üåü Future Improvements
1. **Refresh Time (15s)**:  
   The refresh interval for fetching real-time stock prices is limited to 15 seconds due to API rate constraints. Future improvements can reduce the refresh time by optimizing API usage or integrating **WebSockets** for live updates.

2. **Caching in Local Storage**:  
   While effective, caching is limited to the local storage. A more robust solution could involve **server-side caching** or tools like **Redis** for improved performance.

3. **Historical Data Integration**:  
   Free version of Finnhub API does not provide historical price data, limiting features like historical performance charts. Upgrading to a paid API plan can unlock this functionality, enabling better analysis.

4. **Order Placement Automation**:  
   Introducing a feature for automated order placement when target values are matched would greatly enhance user experience. This functionality is highly promising and could make the app smarter and more proactive in future updates.

By addressing these challenges and implementing the proposed improvements, the application is on the right track to becoming a more powerful and engaging tool for users. üöÄ
